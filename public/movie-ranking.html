<h1>The Best Movies According to Tushar</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Tamasha</h3>
<p>This is one of my favourite movies which shows the story of a boy
who got lost in the rat race of the world
</p>
<h3>Life of pi</h3>
<p>It is a beautifully written fiction film which just blows your mind 
with how great a person can be at imagination and storytelling
</p>
<h3>Fight club</h3>
<p>A movie which challenges your believes and provides you with a different prespective altogether</p>
